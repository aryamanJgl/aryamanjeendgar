[[file:./me.jpg]] Hi! I am Aryaman Jeendgar, a 3rd year undergrad from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus double majoring in Physics and Electronics and Communications engineering.

Broadly, I am interested in research problems with a mathematical flavor, and love writing code to serve solutions to such problems!


I will be spending this summer writing open source code for [[https://www.cvxpy.org/][CVXPY]], under the [[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/][GSoC-2022]] program and interning at Intel Labs in the /Emerging Visual/AI Systems (EVS)/ Research group!

In the past, I have worked with [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/snehanshus/profile][Professor Snehanshu Saha]] (BITS Goa) and [[https://www.wadhwaniai.org/team/soma-dhavala/][Mr. Soma S. Dhavala]] (Wadhwani AI), a pre-print of our latest work can be found [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360464973_LogGENE_A_smooth_alternative_to_check_loss_for_Deep_Healthcare_Inference_Tasks][*HERE*]].
