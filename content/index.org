Hi! I am Aryaman Jeendgar, a 4th year undergrad from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus double majoring in Physics and Electronics and Communications engineering.

Broadly, I am interested in research problems with a mathematical flavor, and love writing code to serve solutions to such problems!

I am currently a *Research Engineer Fellow* @ Princeton University (under /Princeton Research Computing/), contributing to the ongoing =scikit-HEP= effort. I am also participating as a part of the =GSoC-2023= program, where I am (once again!) contributing to CVXPY!

I will be spending the first chunk of my undergraduate thesis working with [[https://rileyjmurray.wordpress.com/][Dr. Riley J. Murray]] at /Sandia National Laboratories/, where I will be working on theoretical problems concerning the Operator Relative Entropy! The second half of my thesis will potentially be spent at /Amazon Science, Luxembourg/ working with the supply chain optimization team on building operations research tools and methods for Amazon Fulfillment centres (FC's).

I spent the summer of /'22/ writing open source code for [[https://www.cvxpy.org/][CVXPY]], under the [[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/][GSoC-2022]] program and interning at Intel Labs in the /Cloud Systems/ Research group!

In the past, I have worked with [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/snehanshus/profile][Professor Snehanshu Saha]] /(BITS Goa)/ and [[https://www.wadhwaniai.org/team/soma-dhavala/][Mr. Soma S. Dhavala]] /(Wadhwani AI)/, a pre-print of our latest work can be found [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09333][*HERE*]]
